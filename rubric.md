# Project Assessment Rubric

**Project:** Recipe CookBook Program
**Section:** C2B
**Course:** Object Oriented Programming

## Grading Breakdown

### 1. Class Diagram Completeness (25%)
**Score:** 3/5
**Notes:** Class diagram is referenced via Figma link (https://www.figma.com/board/eo0EduzGqcxnnxhwnSgDXB/Recipe-Cook-Book-Program). While having a diagram is positive, external links can become inaccessible. A local image or PDF would be more reliable. Cannot fully verify diagram completeness without viewing the Figma board.

### 2. Java Program - OOP Concepts (50%)
**Score:** 5/5
**Notes:** Excellent implementation of all four OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields in Recipe class (name, ingredients, cookingTimeMinutes, etc.) with public getters/setters
- **Inheritance:** Clear inheritance hierarchy with Recipe as abstract base class, extended by MainDish, Dessert, and SideDish
- **Polymorphism:** Abstract methods (cook(), calculateTotalCalories()) overridden in subclasses; interface Cookable implemented
- **Abstraction:** Abstract Recipe class and Cookable interface demonstrate abstraction; each subclass provides specific implementations

### 3. Git Usage & Collaboration (15%)
**Score:** 4/5
**Notes:** Good collaboration evident with 3 contributors: cazonmolly (19 commits), ralphiancomendador (6 commits), and Michael Ong (1 commit). Decent distribution shows active participation, though one contributor dominates. Good team effort overall.

### 4. Base Grade (10%)
